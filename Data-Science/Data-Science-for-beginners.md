## So what’s Data Science?

But, I guess one question comes prior to whats’s data science that is **WHAT’S DATA**?

A data is a set of characters, numbers, symbols which are stored. Now what after being stored? A data which gets stored is then transferred as an INFORMATION.

**Information** refers to the data which is useful to a person.

Real time examples, may help to visualise more precisely than just reading out the content. **So let’s dive into a simple example to know the difference between a data and an information.**

You are at a railway station. Your train name is Rajdhani Express having train number as 1234 moving from Delhi to Mumbai.

You might have noticed a screen on top at the platform which has all the present and upcoming train names and train numbers.

Guess what! All those names and numbers are the DATA that has been stored, but your train number and name isn’t only data anymore for you because, the announcement regarding anything of your train, becomes useful for you which gets passed on as an information.

So data turns into INFORMATION with respect to your needs and interests.


**Now, let us understand what is Data Science actually!**
- Data Science is simply Data + Science in the real world. As you are now familiar with the word data, let’s move on to the term Science. SCIENCE means a study.
- Study on any observations in the world be it objects, people, flora fauna, galaxy and so on. To study anything you want something for reference right! Here comes the data in action.
- Data and Science holding hand in hand helps in business purposes, researches etc.

**But why is Data Science important?**

1. Data Science helps in decision-making throughout the organisation. Awareness about a particular topic, helps you to know what could be transformed into information and help to grow your organisation and what could be just thrown out of the mind. A Data Scientist observes, manages and manipulates the data to improve decision-making.

2. Helps in productive modelling, forecasting, big data. Oops! A lot of new terms appeared. Looks like we need to check on them.
   
3. Forecasting helps in the process of prediction based on the past and the present data they have. For instance, a Hotel is merged with an Airline, forecasting helps to predict how many passengers are interested to avail the same hotel that the airline is merged with.

4. But how is productive modelling related to this?

   **Productive modelling**, helps to predict in a more minute format. Taking the above example in reference, productive modelling will further help to predict how many passengers are likely to avail a suite in the hotel.

5. Big data is a large set having complex structure. It is usually difficult to deal with the data out here with the traditional process.

## Applications of Data Science!

Use of Data Science could be in two ways. In product based and in service based. Product based refers to launching tangible technology, where they try to deliver their product to the costumers, whereas service based refers to intangible services that is they do not have any product to market, but their primary business is to provide service.

Some of the examples of a product-based and service based Companies:

**Product-based** — Amazon, Myntra, HCL, Uber, Intel, Samsung and so on.

**Service-based** — PhonePe, Airtel, Deloitte, TCS and so on.

## Domains that widely use Data Science:

Social Media, Medical field, Sports, Search Engines, Restaurants, Airlines.

**Data collection** — Retrieving data from the resources. Resources could be any database, API’s, surveys, sensor data.

**Data preprocessing** — This means, preparing the data for data analysis. This includes data cleaning, finding the missing values, altering the data, normalising the data, encoding variable to numeric numbers, and to deal with outliers.

**Data analysis** — To find the statistical value of the data i.e; mean, mode, median. Also, plotting the historical plot, box plot and scatter plots.

**Data visualisation** — This includes bar charts, line plots, heat maps.

There are many data types, but I am keeping it till the beginner needs. So there are two which one should know when they are starting with data science, that is categorical data and numerical data. Categorical data is further divided into Nominal data and Ordinal data.

**CATEGORICAL DATA** — From the word ‘category’ you can understand that categorical means the data could be identified by labels.

Now, what does Nominal Data means?

**NOMINAL DATA** represents labels with no ‘inherent order’ in them. Like, yes or no, types of animals etc. These do not depend upon the earlier stage of the data.

But, ORDINAL DATA does depend upon the stage of the earlier data. They do have ‘inherent order’ within them. Example, like school data (Junior, Senior), (Poor, Good, Average, Excellent).

**NUMERICAL DATA** — This just simply plays with numeric values, which could be an integer, float, double etc. But this also has two types such as discrete and continuous.

**DISCRETE** here means, having distinct values i.e; being in a noticeable gap and CONTINUOUS means any numeric values being in the boundaries of the precision.

That’s all with the Game of Data!

But, still it’s not over yet! As, Data Science is a vast domain. There is a lot to do!

**I spoke about Data Pipelining! But why is it important to do?**

Data pipelining simply refers to cleaning and modifying right!! Yes so Data Preprocessing and Data Cleaning helps to improve the quality of data which then gets ease for data mining.

So, it helps to get the best accuracy of any statistical value or model value.

Again, let us understand this by an example,

Now if you having an end semester examination and you are given the whole syllabus pdf by the teacher. But, you still expect the teachers to mark the important topics that would definitely come in the exam. Right!!

Just like that! For a better result Data preprocessing and Data cleaning is very important.

**LANGUAGES USED:**

**PYTHON** is widely used in Data Science as it already has many data science libraries imported which makes the user to easily code, and decreases the time complexity.

**BECAUSE DATA SCIENTISTS VALUE THEIR TIME THE MOST, PLAYING WITH THE DATA IS MORE IMPORTANT !!**

Secondly, **R** is used for this domain because it has static graphics that produce good quality of data visualisation.

**PLATFORMS TO IMPLEMENT:** Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm, VsCode

**MOST USED LIBRARIES:**

pandas, matplotlib, numpy, seaborn[beginner level]

scikit-learn, scipy, pytorch [intermmediate]

keras, tensorflow, OpenCV and there are many more.
