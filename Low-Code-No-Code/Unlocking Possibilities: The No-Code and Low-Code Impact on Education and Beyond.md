**Introduction to LC/NC**

According to Gartner’s recent research, by 2025, 70% of new apps built by enterprises would use low-code or no-code technologies, up from less than 25% in 2020. While software is developed to address business problems, internal IT teams are losing ground to business teams who can no longer wait months for a server to be provisioned when they can simply go to the cloud with a credit card. Similarly, they are experimenting with new applications on their own, sometimes without the involvement of IT. Business teams/Clients can design their own applications using a low-code/no-code approach. With point-and-click or pull-down menu interfaces, users can usually design and implement their individual or departmental systems in a few hours. The software may also have a conversational or search interface. Few, if any, programming skills are required. Robotic process automation (RPA), for example, is one of the fastest-growing categories of LC/NC systems. In this blog we will learn in depth about LC/NC and learn different advantages, Disadvantages, future and many different sides of LC/NC.

## When to use low-code vs. when to use no-code

Low-code and no-code each have their own advantages. This choice is not made any easier by the two’s similarities. The wisest course of action is to evaluate the demands of the present and choose appropriately.

To ascertain user demands, consider the following queries:

What objectives are there when employing low-code or no-code software?

Who are the users? How well-versed in programming are they?

What is the size and extent of the issue that has to be resolved?

Does the build call for specialised internal and external application integrations?

What is the required turnaround time?

How much control over the code do consumers wish to keep?

Does the application need to handle sensitive information or take security into account?

What is the program used for and who will construct it are the two most important queries in this situation. Although both of these are significant issues, it is preferable to take a goal-centric rather than a user-centric approach, meaning that the what is more crucial than the who.

Low-code is the preferable solution if the use cases are complicated, call for connections with other on-premises or cloud apps, have customer-facing or business-critical needs, or need to be distributed across the enterprise. In this situation, even if users lack the necessary proficiency in programming languages, collaborations with IT teams or training programs can address the issues.
